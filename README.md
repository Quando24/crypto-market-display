# crypto-market-display

## Description

Group One's motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly application that will allow end users to pull and compare cryptocurrency market data from three different APIs via a single, streamlined website.  The UI is simple, clean, and displays relevant market data for cryptocurrencies, including percentage change, price, symbol, market cap, and total supply.  The site also gives a five-day price history for each currency that is actively being displayed.  Using local storage, past search history is displayed in the form of a button that can be used to pull current details on any previously referenced cryptocurrency.
